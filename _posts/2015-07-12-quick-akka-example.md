title: Quick Akka Example
---

Before some months there was everywhere on internet a math problem regarding Cheryl's birthday.
Since i was studying Akka and was really intrigued by its wonderful human-like way of solving problems (which by the way solves also all your concurrency problems as well) using simple request-response messages so i wrote a simple Akka program to solve the problem.

In summary the problem is the following (see [wikipedia description][1]):

Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates:

+ **May**: 15, 16, 19
+ **June**: 17, 18  
+ **July**: 14, 16
+ **August**: 14, 15, 17


Cheryl tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively. And then we have the following dialog between Albert and Bernard.

* Albert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know too.
* Bernard: At first I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.
* Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.

So when is Cheryl's birthday?

First the main app follows, which basically represents Cheryl who sends both to Albert and Bernard the initial StartMessage encapsulating
the following data:

* a list of tuples representing the available dates
* the day to Bernard and the month to Albert
* references to ecah other so that then they can have their own dialog

```Scala
import akka.actor._

object FindSolutionApp extends App {
  val system = ActorSystem("FindSolutionAppSystem")
  val albert = system.actorOf(Props[Albert], name = "albert")
  val bernard = system.actorOf(Props[Bernard], name = "bernard")

  val dates = (15, "May") ::(16, "May") ::(19, "May") ::(17, "Jun") ::(18, "Jun") ::(14, "Jul") :: (16, "Jul") ::(14, "Aug") ::(15, "Aug") ::(17, "Aug") :: Nil

  println("App -> Start to Bernard")
  bernard ! StartBernard(16, dates, albert)

  println("App -> Start to Albert ")
  albert ! StartAlbert("Jul", dates, bernard)

  Thread.sleep(2000);
  system.shutdown()

}
```

The messages exchanged are

```Scala
class StartMessage(dates: List[(Int, String)])

case class StartBernard(day: Integer, dates: List[(Int, String)], albert: ActorRef) extends StartMessage(dates)

case class StartAlbert(month: String, dates: List[(Int, String)], bernard: ActorRef) extends StartMessage(dates)

case object No

case object BothNo

case object Found

case object FoundWithHelp

```

Actor representing Bernard waits initially only a **StartBernard** message and after it arrives, it processes and either finishes if the birthday is found or continues exchanging message to Albert and changing receive state so as to wait for further communication from Albert.

```Scala
class Bernard extends Actor {
  var matchingDates: List[(Int, String)] = Nil
  var monthsOfUniqueDays: Iterable[String] = Nil

  def receive = {
    case StartBernard(day, dates, albertRef) => {
      println("Bernard received Start")
      // finds and saves the List of months cotaining unique days
      monthsOfUniqueDays = getMonthsHavingUniqueDay(dates)
      // finds and saves the matching dates given the input day
      matchingDates = dates.filter(_._1 == day)
      matchingDates.length match {
        case 1 => {
          println("Bernard found: " + matchingDates.map { case ((k, v)) => k + ", " + v }.head)
          println("Bernard -> Found to Albert")
          albertRef ! Found
          context.stop(self)
        }
        case 0 => {
          println("Invalid Input not existing day in input list ")
          println("Bernard -> No to Albert")
          albertRef ! No
        }
        case _ =>
      }
      context.become(waitResponseFormAlbert, true)
    }
  }

  def waitResponseFormAlbert: Receive = {
    case BothNo => { 
      println("Bernard received BothNo") 
      //means that no month belonging to unique day month list was given to Albert
      // so we need to filter out from the matching dates all the possible months containing unique days 
      val filterOutUniqueMonths = matchingDates.filterNot(tuple => monthsOfUniqueDays.exists(_ == tuple._2))
      // in case length is 1 we found it
      filterOutUniqueMonths.length match {
        case 1 => {
          println("Bernard found: " + filterOutUniqueMonths.map { case ((k, v)) => k + ", " + v }.head)
          println("Bernard -> FoundWithHelp to App")
          sender ! FoundWithHelp
          context.stop(self)
        }
        case _ => {
          println("Bernard cannot find: " + filterOutUniqueMonths)
          println("Bernard -> No to App")
          sender ! No
        }
      }
    }

    case No =>
      println("Bernard received No")
  }
}
```

Actor representing Albert similarly waits only a **StartAlbert** message initially and after it arrives, it processes and either finishes if the birthday is found or continues exchanging message to Bernard and changing receive state so as to wait for further communication from Bernard.

```Scala
class Albert extends Actor {
  var matchingDates: List[(Int, String)] = Nil
  var allDates: List[(Int, String)] = Nil
  var sentOtherAlsoNo = false
  var inputMonth: String = ""

  def receive = {

    case StartAlbert(month, dates, bernard) => {
      println("Albert received Start")
      allDates = dates
      inputMonth = month
      // finds and saves the matching dates given the input month
      matchingDates = dates.filter(p => p._2 == month)
      matchingDates.length match {
        case 1 => {
          println("Albert found: " + matchingDates.map { case ((k, v)) => k + ", " + v }.head)
          println("Albert -> Found to Bernard")
          bernard ! Found
          context.stop(self)
        }
        case 0 => {
          println(s"Invalid Input not existing $month in input list ")
          println("Albert -> No to Bernard")
          bernard ! No
        }
        case _ => {
          println("Albert -> BothNo to Bernard")
          bernard ! BothNo
        }
      }
      //after the StartMessage processing, change receiving state
      context.become(waitResponseFormBernard, true)
    }


  }

  def waitResponseFormBernard: Receive = {
    case FoundWithHelp => {
      println("Albert received FoundWithHelp")
      val monthsOfUniqueDays = getMonthsHavingUniqueDay(allDates)
      // filter out months of unique days as Bernard found it but with help meaning it couldn't find it without help.
      val remainingValidDates = allDates.filterNot(tuple => monthsOfUniqueDays.exists(_ == tuple._2))
      val uniqueRemaining = remainingValidDates.groupBy(_._1).map { case (k, v) => (k, v.map(_._2)) }.filter(_._2.length == 1)
      // filter from matching dates only the remaining valid dates and if this is 1 then we found it
      matchingDates = matchingDates.filter(each => uniqueRemaining.exists(p => p._1 == each._1))
      if (matchingDates.length == 1)
        println("Albert found: " + matchingDates.map { case ((k, v)) => k + ", " + v }.head)
      else
        println("Albert cannot find it")
    }

    case Found => {
      println("Albert received Found")
      // should be unique since the other found it without help
      val found = allDates.groupBy(_._1).map { case (k, v) => (k, v.map(_._2)) }
        .filter(_._2.length == 1).filter(month => month._2.contains(inputMonth)).map { case (k, v) => k + ", " + v.head }

      if (found.size == 1) println(s"Albert found also ${found.head}")
    }

    case No =>
      println("Albert received No")

    case BothNo =>
      println("Albert received BothNo")

  }
}
```

a simple utility object has been used to return a List of months having unique days

```Scala
object getMonthsHavingUniqueDay {
  def apply(dates: List[(Int, String)]): Iterable[String] = {
    // map of day to List of Months having this day (foldLeft)
    val monthsListPerDay = (Map[Int, List[String]]() /: dates) {
      (map, x) => map + (x._1 -> (x._2 :: map.getOrElse(x._1, Nil)))
    }

    // filter only the ones which have 1 month in the list
    val filterOnlyUniqueDays = monthsListPerDay.filter(_._2.length == 1)

    // flat map of the remaining list of tuples for the second element (month)
    filterOnlyUniqueDays.flatMap(dayMonths => dayMonths._2)
  }
}
```

sbt file with Akka dependencies are
```Scala
name := "SimpleAkkaExample"

version := "1.0"

resolvers += "Typesafe Repository" at "http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/"

libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-actor" % "2.1.2"
```

Running the program for the correct answer 16 Jul prints the following self-describing information about the flow of messages:
+ App -> Start to Bernard
+ App -> Start to Albert 
+ Bernard received Start
+ Albert received Start
+ Albert -> BothNo to Bernard
+ Bernard received BothNo
+ Bernard found: 16, Jul
+ Bernard -> FoundWithHelp to App
+ Albert received FoundWithHelp
+ Albert found: 16, Jul

Running the progrma with another input having a unique day (e.g. 19 May) prints the following:
+ App -> Start to Bernard
+ App -> Start to Albert 
+ Bernard received Start
+ Albert received Start
+ Albert -> BothNo to Bernard
+ Bernard found: 19, May
+ Bernard -> Found to Albert
+ Albert received Found
+ Albert found also 19, May
